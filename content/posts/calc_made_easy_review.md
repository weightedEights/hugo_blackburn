Many more in-depth reviews are available at [GoodReads][1], so I wont belabor this
much.

The writing style is so easy-going the subject matter is interesting and almost
fun. Silvanus makes a difficult learning curve much more approachable by bringing
abstract concepts down to earth, often with simple illustrations.

The first publication date is 1910, so there are free PDF versions available. Or
if you like the navigability of the Kindle version, its $3 in the store. One of
my top recommendations for learning calculus for the first time or for
re-visiting the fundamentals.
