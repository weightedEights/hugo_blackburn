## Baofeng UV-5R

A cheap beginner dual-band handheld with enough features to be useful. Lots of extensive reviews exist, so Ill just touch on my limited use case.

[This kit][2] is the one I started with which includes a spare battery, whip antenna, programming cable, and "other stuff". Good value for what is included.

## Antennas and Accessories

The stock UV-5R antenna is useable, but many options exist to support specific use cases.

#### Baofeng SMA-to-BNC Adapters

[BNC-to_SMA Adapters][1]. Cheap, easy, no brainer kit addition.

#### Longer Range Whip

[This particular whip][3] came in the above-mentioned kit and fits the UV-5R very well, with a good seal when finger-tight. Performance while hiking has been acceptable in the Santa Cruz mountains, but I havent compared it to others. Some of the critical Amazon reviews may warrant another look at some better options. Antenna is very "whippy", so not convenient when clipping the radio onto a pocket.

#### Shorter Range Stubby

Not good option: [The official Baofeng stubby][4] was an acceptable build quality, but when screwed on did not seal to the radio body. It left a gap of brassy threads just begging for grit and junk to work in.

Great option (albeit pricey): [Diamond RHF10 (BNC)][5] This antenna can be found for about $20, if you look. Since it fits to the BNC adapters, and the adapters fit very well with the UV-5R, there are no gaps when this is mounted. Build quality is quite high, a bit weightier than the Baofeng, with acceptable performance you would expect from a shorter range antenna. Easily fits in a pocket, making for a compact "field coordination" handheld.

#### Zipper/Molle Pouch

Always preferable to keep bits and pieces organized, a zipper pouch works exceedingly well.

[This pouch][6] (or any like it of a similar size) has an interior sleeve where I stow spare batteries, with some extra protection for the contacts. The UV-5R cradle and power supply fit in here, SMA adapters, stubby and medium-length whips, PTT accessories, programming cable.. hard to think of what wont fit. Keep all the bits you might need all in once place.
