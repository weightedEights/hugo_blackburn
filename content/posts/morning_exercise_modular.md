# Daily Bodyweight Fitness Routines

## Bottom Line Up Front
Just starting is the hardest part, so start here. Do enough reps to feel the burn, then push through a few more.

{{< pure_table
"Legs | Core | Upper"

Make your morning routing something like this:

1. Get out of bed
3. Drink whole glass of water
4. Do morning exercise

This activates all of the major muscle groups in your body, signaling to your brain
and neural connections "Hey, get this body ready for action".

The point here is not to do a "morning workout", so reps to failure is not the objective. The point is to wake up the muslces and mind, get the blood pumping, and get your furnace stoked (activate your metabolism).

## Color It In
One of my favorite body weight fitness Youtube channels is [Gold Medal Bodies (GMB)][1]. This is the place anyone can start, regardless of fitness or ability. This is a regular guy doing regular, functional body movements that you would expect your body to do every day. I have been doing this morning routine at home on the carpet, on vacation on a wood porch, and in hotels next to the bed with a towel on the ground. Any place, any time.

### Squats
