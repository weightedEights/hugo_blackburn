## Baofeng UV-5R

A cheap, reliable, and user-friendly handheld. Dual-band, so capable of VHF/2m (136 - 174MHz) and UHF/70cm (400 - 480MHz) amateur bands. This radio can easily be programmed to only operate on public, license-free bands and makes for an excellent "walkie-talkie" with much better range than comparably priced handhelds.

Disclaimer: the UV-5R radio, in its default configuration, is capable of transmitting on the licensed amateur bands. Without a license, **transmitting with a device that is capable of these bands** is a $10, 000 offense. The FCC will find you. The best course of action is to study for and take the HAM Technician class exam, which legally opens up the full capability of the radios mentioned here.
