## Intro
Many more in-depth reviews are available at [GoodReads][1], so I wont belabor this
much.

Reduce living expenses. Save your money. How to save? Invest.

## Point of Investing
Restate the obvious: put your dollars to work by lending them to companies

## Keyword: "Total Market Index"
Buy all 3700 stocks being traded in the market. Worse case is some go to zero, best case is some go up 10,000%

## Compared to Bank On Yourself
This is a product being sold by life insurance managers. You are the product.

## Real Number Comparison
Over 30 years. From age 30 to 60, 1980 to 2010. Total Stock index compared to BOYS.


## Quotes
> "The great irony of investing is that the more you watch and fiddle with your holdings the less well you are likely to do. Fill your basket, add as much as you can along the way and ignore it the rest of the time."
>>---J.L. Collins "The Simple Path to Wealth" pg 106

> "Here's the basket: VTSAX. ... This is the Total Stock Market Index Fund that holds virtually every publicly traded company in the U.S. That means you'll be owning a part of about 3,700 businesses across the country, making it a very big and diverse basket."
>>---J.L. Collins "The Simple Path to Wealth" pg 106
