# About This Project
Depending on how many events are aggregated here, this page could get big. At that point I'll have to make the title collapsible or something. For the time being it will be a scroll-fest.

# North America
Anything North of the Panama Canal.

## 1874 Huge Locust Swarm
Described in detail at [Historynet.com][1]. The geographic scale of the swarm is summarized partway through:

>"A map produced by the state of Missouri shows that the 1874 infestation spread from the eastern slope of the Rockies into western Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri and from the Canadian Prairie provinces to central Texas, just north of Austin. Generally it moved from north to south."

A swarm larger than the state of California, taking 5 days to pass by. Unreal.
