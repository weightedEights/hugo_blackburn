## Scrub The Air
Back in the '80s NASA conducted studies on plants suitable for ["Indoor Air Pollution Abatement"][1]. The Sansevieria family of plants were excellent performers and have the added benefit of being hardy succulents, requiring little water and indirect sunlight. A living plant is calming in my work space and the added air quality benefit makes this an easy choice for the amount of space it takes.

#### The Plant
The sansevieria fernwood variety happens to be [$7 at Ikea][2]. Transfer it into a [BOYSENBÃ„R concrete pot][3] and I have a tangible quality of life improvement.

#### The Plant Care
According to [Plantophiles.net][4] the number one risk in caring for a snake plant is over-watering. So, always on the lookout for electronics or microcontroller projects, automating and tracking the soil moisture seems like a perfect fit.  

#### Automate The Plant Care
Once again Adafruit has anticipated this application with their penchant for urbanite microcontroller projects. The [Bonsai Buckaroo Plant Care Kit][5] takes the stage. Together with a [Clue microcontroller][6] you can sense, log, and control the soil moisture in a package that comes with a tidy display and a host of other sensors. Granted, the Clue is expensive and way overpowered for this application, but for development its a perfect choice.
